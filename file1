Geography is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography.[4][5] Human geography deals with the study of people and their communities, cultures, economies and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across space and place.[6] Physical geography deals with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment like the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere.
